Ruby has RuboCop as a popular linter that gives them automation options to fix whatever error the code may have.
Medium recommends RSpec for testing because it makes them expressible and easy to understand, this way the programmers won't have to figure out the tests and will debug problems faster.
Looks like Ruby-build is the default builder for this language and, for what I was able to research, there doesn't seem to be different approaches to building in Ruby.

A CI option that is popular for Ruby is CircleCI, this framework is intended for teams of all sizes, and offers multiple pricing options going from free, all the way to over $2000 a month. They pride themselves on their flexibility, not only for the framework itself, but for the different plans they have.

Since CircleCI is meant to be used by teams that vary in size, I would think that the framework works well with either self-hosted or cloud-based environments. A student, or anyone in general, is able to use CircleCI without a hit to their financials and a larger company will use the full potential of the service. They also offer performance insights and support 24/7 for all the company's needs.
